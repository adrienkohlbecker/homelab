    # While building in VMWare, restart after installation causes change in IP address of the instance. This leads packer build to timeout awaiting SSH connection. To fix this issue, we can configure MAC address to be send as identifier in DHCP request.
    # dhcp-identifier: mac
    # Since there is no option to set dhcp-identifier via cloud config, this is appended to ens33 interface in /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml via late-commands.
