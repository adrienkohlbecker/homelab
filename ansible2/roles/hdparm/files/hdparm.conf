## This is the default configuration for hdparm for Debian.
## Any line that begins with a comment is ignored - add as many as you
## like.  Note that an in-line comment is not supported.  If a line
## consists of whitespace only (tabs, spaces, carriage return), it will be
## ignored, so you can space control fields as you like.  ANYTHING ELSE
## IS PARSED!!  This means that lines with stray characters or lines that
## use non # comment characters will be interpreted by the helper scripts (
## /lib/udev/hdparm, /usr/lib/pm-utils/power.d/95hdparm-apm ).
## This has probably minor, but potentially serious, side effects for your
## hard drives, so please follow the guidelines.  Patches to improve
## flexibilty welcome.  Please read /usr/share/doc/hdparm/README.Debian for
## notes about known issues, especially if you have an MD array.
##
## Note that if the init script causes boot problems, you can pass 'nohdparm'
## on the kernel command line, and hdparm will not run.
##
## Uncommenting the options below will cause them to be added to the DEFAULT
## string which is prepended to options listed in the blocks below.
##
## If an option is listed twice, the second instance replaces the first.
##
## /sbin/hdparm parses blocks of the form:
##      DEV {
##         option
##         option
##         ...
##      }
## This blocks will cause /sbin/hdparm OPTIONS DEV to be run.
## Where OPTIONS is the concatenation of all options previously defined
## outside of a block and all options defined with in the block.

## Blocks beginning with the keyword 'command_line' instead of a device
## identifier are not supported since the version 9.39-1 for backward
## compatibility by this version of hdparm. Options must be introduced
## by a correct device identifier instead, so that they will be applied
## when the device becomes available.
